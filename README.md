## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª SQL queries
I employ simple SQL queries to extract and aggregate data from the relational database and use more complex queries with **GROUP BY, LEFT JOIN, and sub-queries** to gain insights into customer preferences. Then, I use nested and correlated nested queries, utilizing functions like **EXISTS and UNION** to categorize customers, movies, actors, and more. Finally, I apply **OLAP extensions in SQL, such as CUBE, ROLLUP, and GROUPING SETS** operators, to aggregate data on multiple levels for deeper analysis.
